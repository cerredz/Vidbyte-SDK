# Vidbyte SDK Structure

Use this reference when modifying the Vidbyte SDK package structure.

## Current Layout

```text
vidbyte/
|-- client.py
|-- harnesses/
|   `-- client.py
|-- providers/
|   `-- client.py
|-- tools/
|   `-- client.py
|-- shared/
`-- lib/
    |-- dataclasses/
    |-- tools/
    `-- errors/
```

## Rules

- Keep `vidbyte/` as the top-level Python package namespace.
- Keep namespace clients in `vidbyte/harnesses/`, `vidbyte/tools/`, and `vidbyte/providers/`.
- Keep internal library helpers under `vidbyte/lib/`.
- Keep SDK dataclass definitions under `vidbyte/lib/dataclasses/`; package-local type modules should re-export those contracts when stable imports are needed.
- Keep SDK error modules under `vidbyte/lib/errors/`.
- Keep provider-neutral tool formatting helpers under `vidbyte/lib/tools/`.
- Keep shared SDK scaffolding under `vidbyte/shared/`.
- Advanced tools are approved under `vidbyte/tools/` when they follow the shared `BaseTool`, `ToolSpec`, `ToolRegistry`, and `ToolExecutor` contracts.
- Keep built-in tool categories under `vidbyte/tools/builtins/`; current approved categories are `code_search`, `editing`, and `context`.
- Keep MCP bridge code under `vidbyte/tools/mcp/`.
- Keep permission and sandbox abstractions under `vidbyte/tools/security/`.
- Mutating or executable tools must declare `WRITE` or `EXECUTE` permissions and be guarded by the executor permission policy.
