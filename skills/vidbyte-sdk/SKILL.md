# Vidbyte SDK Structure

Use this reference when modifying the Vidbyte SDK package structure.

## Rules

- Keep `vidbyte/` as the top-level Python package namespace.
- Keep namespace clients in `vidbyte/harnesses/`, `vidbyte/tools/`, and `vidbyte/providers/`.
- Keep agent actor abstractions in `vidbyte/agents/`.
- Keep reasoning and orchestration topologies in `vidbyte/strategies/`.
- Keep multi-agent orchestration implementations in `vidbyte/strategies/multi_agent/`.
- Keep public context objects in `vidbyte/context/`, but define dataclasses centrally under `vidbyte/lib/dataclasses/`.
- Keep prompt templates in `vidbyte/prompts/prompts/` and expose them through `vidbyte.prompts.Prompts` plus `vidbyte.lib.enums.prompts.Prompt`.
- Follow `skills/vidbyte-sdk/adding-prompts.md` whenever adding or changing prompt assets.
- Keep enum presets under `vidbyte/lib/enums/`.
- Keep internal library helpers under `vidbyte/lib/`.
- Keep SDK dataclass definitions under `vidbyte/lib/dataclasses/`; package-local type modules should re-export those contracts when stable imports are needed.
- Keep SDK error modules under `vidbyte/lib/errors/`.
- Keep provider-neutral tool formatting helpers under `vidbyte/lib/tools/`.
- Keep shared SDK scaffolding under `vidbyte/shared/`.
- Advanced tools are approved under `vidbyte/tools/` when they follow the shared `BaseTool`, `ToolSpec`, `Tools`, and agent-local execution contracts. `ToolRegistry` and `ToolExecutor` are compatibility/lower-level strategy infrastructure, not the preferred public workflow.
- Keep built-in tool categories under `vidbyte/tools/builtins/`; current approved categories are `code_search`, `editing`, and `context`.
- Keep MCP bridge code under `vidbyte/tools/mcp/`.
- Keep permission and sandbox abstractions under `vidbyte/tools/security/`.
- Mutating or executable tools must declare `WRITE` or `EXECUTE` permissions and be guarded by the agent or compatibility executor permission policy.
- Harnesses should compose strategies through `with_strategy()` and `with_strategies()` rather than exposing single-agent or multi-agent flags.
- Agents package model runners, strategies, user-defined role/capability metadata, system prompts, and tools. User-facing examples should pass tools directly into `Agent`/`BaseAgent` with `tools=[...]`.
- Base contexts should expose `build_context()` and keep file content, tool calls, model responses, memory, permissions, artifacts, budget, and strategy progress metadata distinct.
- Tools are injected into agents or strategies; avoid global mutable tool state for orchestration. Prefer `@tool` and `Tools(...)` for new public examples; keep `@vidbyte_tool`, `ToolRegistry`, and `ToolExecutor` references for compatibility notes only.
- Concrete `TextModelRunner`, `ImageModelRunner`, and `VideoModelRunner` classes are internal/advanced implementation details in user-facing docs. Prefer `Agent`/`BaseAgent` or harness composition in examples.
- Do not add provider network calls, remote protocol transports, or private Vidbyte service logic without a separate approved design.
