# Jev Agent

Use this skill for work under `vidbyte/agents/jev/` or when adding a Jev-backed capability to the Vidbyte SDK.

## Product contract

`JevAgent` is an opinionated agent, not a framework for users to assemble arbitrary decisions. Its public constructor accepts one `JevAgentSettings` object. Do not add generic `decisions`, question lists, hooks, action callbacks, runtime selectors, middleware injection, or arbitrary passthrough kwargs.

Expose user intent through named, validated capabilities. Examples include:

- pre-allocated questions answered before a model run;
- dynamic compute allocation;
- multi-agent coordination with explicit agent descriptions and metadata.

Each capability owns its fixed internal Jev questions, state projection, thresholds, actions, fallback policy, and observability. Those internal mechanics are implementation details, not public decision-building blocks.

## Current scaffold

- `settings.py` owns the complete public configuration surface.
- `agent.py` maps settings into `BaseAgent` and fixes the runtime to `AgentRuntimeType.JEV`; it supplies its settings through the single `_runtime_extension_kwargs()` hook.
- `runtime.py` is the seam for Jev policy. `RuntimeRegistry` resolves `AgentRuntimeType.JEV` to `JevRuntime`, which currently inherits the ordinary linear loop unchanged and refuses to build without `JevAgentSettings`.
- `vidbyte/lib/dataclasses/jev.py` owns immutable decision records and the `TypeSafeWireRequest`/`TypeSafeWireQuestion` wire records. They mirror https://docs.typesafe.ai/api.md exactly: state, instructions, and criteria may be strings or JSON structure; noul criteria are optional; Score answers carry a weighted `score`; noul answers carry no confidence.
- `vidbyte/lib/runners/decision.py` owns semantic decision execution (`arun`) and model listing (`alist_models`).
- `vidbyte/providers/typesafe.py` alone owns TypeSafe wire serialization, normalization, and failure mapping.
- `presets.py` exposes the named `JevPreflightPreset` values; `preflight.py` owns the internal `JevPreflight` contract and `JevPreflightTools` implementation.

The default settings perform no Jev call. `JevPreflightPreset.TOOL_SELECTOR` enables one batched tool-usefulness request before the generative loop. `tool_selector_threshold` is a finite probability from 0 through 1 inclusive; a missing TypeSafe API key must not prevent settings or agent construction.

## Change workflow

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/design/jev-agent-scaffold.md`, and every existing file under `vidbyte/agents/jev/`.
2. Describe the user-facing capability in product terms and add a named setting or preset. Keep caller configuration to the minimum product-level controls, such as a validated threshold.
3. Define exactly when the runtime asks Jev, the state Jev sees, the fixed questions asked, and the action for every answer. Write every question with `skills/asking-jev-questions/SKILL.md`: Jev matches state against definitions you supply; it does not reason, count, forecast, or generate.
4. Define fail-open or fail-closed behavior for missing credentials, timeouts, malformed answers, and unsupported configurations. Never let an exception silently choose policy.
5. Implement orchestration in `JevRuntime`; keep provider wire shapes in `vidbyte/providers/typesafe.py` and reusable validated records in `vidbyte/lib/`.
6. Keep generative usage/speed tracking agent-owned. Make decision usage visible without mixing token fields or double counting.
7. Add tests for the disabled path, each enabled outcome, boundary thresholds, provider failure, the ordinary model/tool loop, and any context/schema/tool-catalog changes.
8. Update this skill and the design documentation when the public philosophy or package boundary changes.

## Invariants

- `JevAgent.__init__` accepts only `JevAgentSettings`.
- TypeSafe/Jev cannot be selected as the reply-generating provider.
- API keys never appear in object representations, errors, logs, traces, or serialized state.
- The public API names capabilities, not internal questions or decisions.
- Runtime state is run-local; reusable configuration is frozen and validated before execution.
- Existing `BaseAgent` behavior remains unchanged when Jev is not involved; `AgentRuntimeType.JEV` gets the same linear-loop wiring as `LINEAR`.
- Provider payload dictionaries do not move into `vidbyte/lib` records.
- No live provider call is required by deterministic tests.

## Example construction

```python
from vidbyte import JevAgent, JevAgentSettings

settings = JevAgentSettings(
    name="researcher",
    system_prompt="Research carefully and report evidence.",
    provider="openai",
    model_name="gpt-4.1",
)
agent = JevAgent(settings)
```

The equivalent namespace constructor is `sdk.agents.jev(settings)`.

## Capability design example

For a future `dynamic_compute` setting, expose the user-level choice and useful bounds. Keep questions such as “How much did `last_turn` add beyond `earlier_findings`?” inside the runtime. Ask about what the last turn observably did, not whether another turn will help: Jev answers observations reliably and forecasts poorly. Translate Jev's calibrated answer into a fixed compute policy, record the decision and usage, and test both continued and stopped execution. Do not expose that question as a caller-supplied rule.

## Verification

Run the focused script first:

```text
python scripts/test-jev-agent-scaffold.py
```

Then run repository gates:

```text
python lint/run.py
python scripts/run_ci.py --stage source
python scripts/run_ci.py
```
