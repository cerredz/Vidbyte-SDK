"""FILE: vidbyte/lib/enums/jev.py

PURPOSE: Defines the closed Jev vocabularies: the TypeSafe question types, the preflight presets a JevAgent user can enable, the key of every preflight question, and why specialist routing fell back to the general agent.
ROLE IN CODEBASE: `vidbyte/lib/dataclasses/jev.py` validates questions against these members, `vidbyte/providers/typesafe.py` serializes question types onto the wire, `vidbyte/lib/jev/presets.py` maps each fixed-question preset to its question keys, `vidbyte/lib/jev/preflight/` registers one question per key, `vidbyte/agents/jev/gate/` matches on the presets when it acts on Jev's answers, and `vidbyte/agents/jev/specialists.py` records a JevSpecialistFallback on each general-agent run.
ARCHITECTURE NOTE: The vocabulary lives in `vidbyte.lib` because the provider layer, the record layer, and the tool layer all read it, and the lower two may not import the tool layer.
COMMON MODIFICATION PATTERNS: Add a question type only when TypeSafe documents one, then extend JevQuestion validation and TypeSafeProvider answer normalization in the same change. Add a preflight question key together with its question dataclass in `vidbyte/lib/jev/preflight/` and its preset's key list in `vidbyte/lib/jev/presets.py`.
KNOWN EDGE CASES: `noul` is TypeSafe's own spelling for a yes/no question; keep the serialized value exactly as the API expects it. A question key's value is the answer name Jev returns, so it must stay unique across every preset. TOOL_SELECTOR has no question keys because it asks one question per configured tool, built at run time.
