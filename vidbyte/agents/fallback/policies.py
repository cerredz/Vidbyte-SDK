"""Context Protocol Header

Description:
    Defines the per-hop fallback policy classes: LatencyPolicy and CostBudgetPolicy.
Purpose:
    Lets a developer declare a deadline or a cost ceiling for each transition in a
    fallback chain, so the runtime can advance to the next model proactively instead
    of only reacting to a raised provider exception.
Architecture:
    - LatencyPolicy: One deadline per hop, enforced by wrapping the model call.
    - CostBudgetPolicy: One USD ceiling per hop, checked against live usage.
    - Both expose hop_values() so AgentFallbackSettings can validate array length
      and element values without knowing about either class by name.
Relations:
    Consumed by vidbyte.agents.fallback.chain.AgentFallback (deadline_for/budget_for)
    and validated by vidbyte.agents.fallback.settings.AgentFallbackSettings.
Similar Files:
    - vidbyte/agents/fallback/chain.py: Folds these policies into per-index lookups.
    - vidbyte/agents/fallback/settings.py: Validates hop_values() against chain length.
